# mining-spec
Repository for the Data Mining specialization.

This is the repository for the third course in the MSIT second year specialization.
This repository contains three projects; all involve association rule generation.
Additionally, there is one assignments directory.

**instacart**
The main idea of the project is to implement an association rule generation algorithm from scratch, meaning we start from 1-itemsets and work our way to itemsets of maximal size. Then we generate association rules from these itemsets.

The data is from this URL: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017
**Note: The data is not included in the repo since it's just way too large. To run this program, download the data ZIP file from the URL above and extract the CSV files to data/instacart/ in the project root folder.**


**groceries**
This project is smaller version of the *instacart* project. The datasets are much smaller, so they're included.


**movielens**
This project contains data similar to IMDB. The idea is to build association rules over the movie data.
**Note: Currently, this is the only project that's been completed.*


**mease**
This project contains assignments. The questions are from the Stats202 course at Stanford. The original course is in R. My code is in Python where possible.


The reference material is the Data Mining book by Tan, Steinbach & Kumar.
