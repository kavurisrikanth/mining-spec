# mining-spec
Repository for the Data Mining specialization.

This is the repository for the third course in the MSIT second year specialization.
This repository contains two projects; both involve association rule generation.

**instacart**
The main idea of the project is to implement an association rule generation algorithm from scratch, meaning we start from 1-itemsets and work our way to itemsets of maximal size. Then we generate association rules from these itemsets.

The data is from this URL: https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017


**groceries**
This project is smaller version of the *instacart* project. The datasets are much smaller, so they're included.

The reference material is the Data Mining book by Tan, Steinbach & Kumar.

**Note: The data is not included in the repo since it's just way too large. To run this program, download the data ZIP file from the URL above and extract the CSV files to data/instacart/ in the project root folder.**
